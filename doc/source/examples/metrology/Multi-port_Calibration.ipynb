Multi-port TRL requires thru and one or more lines between the ports which doesn't fit the above class interface. Also if for some reason different two-port calibration methods should be used for the port pairs the `MultiportSOLT` class is not able to do it. For those cases there is a lower level `MultiportCal`.\n",

Other keys are passed to the two-port calibration routine. In this case we are using `UnknownThru` class which requires additional `switch_term` arguments. Note that two-port switch terms are in the reverse order from multi-port switch terms. Two-port switch terms are listed in the order of where the source is connected, but this is unspecified in case of multi-port switch terms and they are listed in the order of which port they terminate. It's also important to list the ideals and measured networks in the correct order required by the two-port calibration. `UnknownThru` assumes that thru should be listed last and order of the other standards doesn't matter."
