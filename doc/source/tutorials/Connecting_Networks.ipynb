    "# Connecting Networks\n",
    "**scikit-rf** supports the connection of arbitrary ports of N-port networks. It accomplishes this using an algorithm called sub-network growth[[1]](#References), available through the function `connect()`. Note that this function takes into account port impedances. If two connected ports have different port impedances, an appropriate impedance mismatch is inserted. This capability is illustrated here with situations often encountered."
